            <p>I work full-time while building my own brand, ERA. Most days are a mix of work, Pilates, and spending time with my family, my boyfriend David, and our dog Coco. I love creating things that bring purpose and am working toward doing more of what feels meaningful.</p>

    <h2>My ERA</h2>

    <div class="era-intro">
      <p>When I created my business, ERA, I didn’t realize how much that name would come to define different parts of my life.</p>
      <p>Each heart represents one of those eras: a period of beginning, growth, and becoming.</p>
      <p>The hearts are black because when I came into Tech Moms, life felt black and white. I didn’t know exactly what I wanted, only that I needed change. I wanted knowledge, direction, and a reason to feel proud again.</p>

        <div id="heart1-story" class="heart-story hidden">
          <h3>1st Heart: The Beginning of ERA</h3>
          <p>This was when I first started ERA & Co. At the time, I was working full-time at Poplin, a remote job that gave me flexibility but drained me emotionally. I was learning how to run a business while trying to stay afloat in a job that made me feel small.</p>
          <p>Through ERA, I taught myself how to register an LLC, design packaging, create incense and candles, and build a Shopify website. I learned how hard it is to get people to care about your product. I made a few sales, but eventually I had to pause. My mental health was slipping, and I needed to find motivation again.</p>

             aria-controls="heart2-story" aria-expanded="false" alt="Black stitched heart" />
        <div id="heart2-story" class="heart-story hidden">
          <h3>2nd Heart: The Growth of ERA</h3>
          <p>After months of burnout, I started going to Pilates every morning. Four months in, my energy came back. That’s when my mom told me about Tech Moms.</p>
          <p>I joined because I needed confidence. I wanted to learn what I was capable of, not just what my job defined me as. I had no idea what HTML, CSS, or JavaScript even meant, but I liked that. Growth starts with being uncomfortable.</p>
          <p>During Tech Moms, I began restructuring my career goals. I rebuilt my resume and started applying for federal jobs. I applied to the IRS and later to a legal position in the federal government.</p>
          <p>That interview changed everything. It wasn’t with HR like I was used to, but with two government lawyers, including the Deputy Chief Counsel. I was terrified but proud. The next day, Poplin announced layoffs and I was told my last day would be December 19. I felt there was a reason for the timing.</p>
          <p>Two weeks later, the lawyer called to say I didn’t get the original job, but he created a new position just for me. A week later, he told me I was selected. I’m now waiting on my background check and drug test to start this new chapter.</p>

          <h3>3rd Heart: The Becoming of ERA</h3>
          <p>This heart represents resilience, learning to trust timing, intuition, and my own worth.</p>
          <p>ERA is not just a business name anymore. It is a reminder that I am always in an era of becoming, learning, rebuilding, and finding purpose through every challenge.</p>
